A real estate agency site I made in 2014. I built it on top of a wordpress theme, which 
as it turned out was a bad idea since I ended up not using most of the native theme functionality and
all it did is get in the way.
Here I either modified existing plugin files to embed it into the theme or wrote them myself.
All the PHP files I wrote can be found at:
```
/<root> 
``` 

JS files written by me are at:
```
/js/general.js
/js/gmap-locations.js
```

Styles written by me at:
```
/css/styles.css
/css/media.css
```
